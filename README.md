# Blocking Primers

This analysis focused on developing a blocking primer specific to sea lamprey (_Petromyzon marinus_).

The blocking primer was designed to bind selectively to sea lamprey DNA, reducing its amplification during PCR. It was used alongside universal primers to prioritize the amplification of host species DNA in dietary samples.
